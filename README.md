This was made in an effort to better understand the material laid out in [The Semantics of K](https://github.com/kframework/kore/blob/master/docs/semantics-of-k.pdf), particularly chapters 4-8, with the underlying components using the definitions given in the Meta K chapter (chapter 7) as opposed to the ones given later in Kore. The 'main.lean' file containins a constructive definition of the example matching logic theory given in chapter 8 that I believe is correct from a conceptual standpoint with the exception of the selection of sorts used for equality in some of the axioms since I'm still not 100% on what goes where and the exact significance of the ceiling/floor sort parameters.
<p>
In any case, I found this to be an immensely helpful exercise, since the many sorted nature of matching logic makes it very mercurial and it was quite difficult at times to figure out how certain constructions worked, since you have to get into the mindset of being able to lift/cast everything into everything else.
